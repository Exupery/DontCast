# DontCast
### World of Warcraft PvP addon
Warns a player when their current target has buffs or debuffs that eliminate (or significantly mitigate) incoming damage. The default buff/debuff list will switch modes (between magical and physical) depending on the current spec of the player. Displays the name and icon of the buff/debuff, as well as a timer displaying a countdown of time remaining until the effect expires. Buffs and debuffs can be added and removed with the appropriate slash commands.

## Default Buffs/Debuffs
* Anti-Magic Shell (Magical mode only)
* Aspect of the Turtle
* Blessing of Protection (Physical mode only)
* Blessing of Spellwarding (Magical mode only)
* Cloak of Shadows (Magical mode only)
* Cyclone
* Deterrence
* Die by the Sword (Physical mode only)
* Diffuse Magic (Magical mode only)
* Dispersion
* Divine Shield
* Ethereal Form (Physical mode only)
* Grounding Totem (Magical mode only)
* Guardian of the Forgotten Queen
* Ice Block
* Imprison
* Nether Ward (Magical mode only)
* Netherwalk
* Paralysis
* Polymorph
* Riposte (Physical mode only)
* Shield of Vengeance
* Smoke Bomb
* Spell Reflection (Magical mode only)
* Temporal Shield
* Touch of Karma

Prior to version 1.3.7 any auras added to the default list (e.g. Dispersion in v1.1.3) would not be enabled for players updating to (or beyond) that DontCast version. This was changed in v1.3.7 (e.g. all players will now have Aspect of the Turtle enabled by default) but this required changing how auras are removed/disabled. As a result any players that prior to v1.3.7 disabled an aura (via `/dontcast remove`) that is on the default list will have that aura re-enabled. Auras disabled in v1.3.7 (or higher) will not be affected by future changes to the default list.
